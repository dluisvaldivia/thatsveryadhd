                    <h1>Who is this for</h1>
                    <p>This space is for those who are ready to try something new, to break free from rigid molds and find what truly works for their brain. If you're:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A late-diagnosed ADHD adventurer who’s still figuring out your flavor</li>
                        <li>Someone who loves an ADHD-er and wants to understand them at the core of their being</li>
                        <li>An entrepreneur or artist whose creativity feels trapped behind the walls of structure</li>
                        <li>A parent who’s been holding the weight of neurodivergence without guidance</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Then, this enchanted space is for you.</p>

                    <p>You're ready to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Stop trying to fit yourself into a mold — it’s like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole</li>
                        <li>Take control without losing yourself to rejection sensitivity — it’s about finding strategies that respect your energy</li>
                        <li>Let go of perfection — real life doesn’t come with a perfect recipe, but it’s yours to shape</li>
                        <li>Build a life that works with your brain — think of it as fine-tuning your engine, like a chef perfecting their dish</li>
                    </ul>
